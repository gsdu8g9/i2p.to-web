[2008-07-?? added 2009-01-26] Sites with no return data currently do not show up in history as 000 site.
If you ever wondered why the yellow 000 destinations vanished while the pink flap count
returned to normal back in July 2008, here is what happened (I do not remember what and when I
changed it, changes were not tracked by CVS these days):
<p>
When probing certain destinations like IRC servers, the existence of these destinations
will currently not be detected.  This is because these destinations do not return anything
on an HTTP request.  So the test script will see 0 bytes, which (for the time being) is
taken as "nothing came back" with return code "000" which in turn is taken as
"check script failed" which in turn is discarded.  Those destinations is supposed to
show up as "000", though, but it does not work, hence a bug.
It is difficult to distinguish this with some transport error which might look
the same (when the connection to the proxy breaks, for example) and which does more
"harm" in regard to "bad times", when something is instable.
<p>
In the status graph you can see when I "fixed" some detection problem back in July 2008,
this is where the high pink flap-line in the graph starts to drop down to normal again.
From this time on the graph does no more show "yellow" status for all those 000 sites.
This fixed a problem, where "red" often was detected wrongly as "yellow", which gives us
a "false" flap and therefor had risen the pink flap counter to countless height.  In contrast,
not detecting the presence of a 000 site is mostly harmless, as you cannot connect there through
the inProxy via HTTP anyway.  However it somehow shows a wrong history of those destinations.
<p>
Consequences from this bug:  Those destinations (like irc.postman.i2p) do not show any history
for successful probes since June 2008.  AFAICS the probe loop does exclude the destinations, too
(as only successful last probed destinations are probed there), and they are partially
probed by the deadloop, which makes 1 to 4 probes each day sent to those sites.
None of those probes shows up in the history if it is successful, if not, it is shown
in history as "red" or sometimes "yellow" (gateway timeout).  So a missing(!) entry in the
history currently shows that the probe was successful for such destinations.  Weird.
<p>
Fixing this bug has a very very very low priority.

[2008-08-28] Slingshot-Routing Bug fixed:
When comming from I2P links no more point outside I2P if possible.
<br>
However, two issues remain:
<ul>
<li> Still a lot of links point outside I2P, there is missing a warning page for that case.</li>
<li> Addresshelper support is still not implemented</li>
</ul>

[2005-11-29] The mirroring facility (Mirror link above) does not work as expected.
I don't put a lot of effort into this, as this is not an important feature.

[GLOBAL] There is a global BUG which makes it impossible to use (permanent) Cookies through my I2PinProxy.
This lack of feature is by design.  It is not thought to be fixed.
<P>
<b>This means for you:</b>
You cannot login into forums or post stuff onto boards in I2P through this I2PinProxy
if Cookies are involved.  If you want to use Cookies, please consider installing I2P.
